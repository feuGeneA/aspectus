aspectus: aspect + prospectus. Generates iCalendars of astrological aspects.

Determines future astrological aspects of celestial bodies, as viewed from a specific geographic location, and produces an .ics iCalendar file containing events for each occurring aspect.

Currently supports only trines and sextants, and only between the Earth and Sun.  These aspects are derived from the altitude of the Sun, with 30 degrees implying a trine (120 degrees, as 30 from sun to horizon, plus 90 degrees between line to horizon and line to center of Earth) and -30 degrees implying a sextant (60 degrees, as -30 from horizon down to sun, minus the -90 degree altitude of the earth's core).

Support for other bodies besides the Sun could be added very easily.

Support for other aspects besides trines and sextants could be added with not TOO much work.

Support for aspects between two celestial bodies, rather than between one celestial body and the center of the earth, would be great to have, but it would not be well supported by the current altitude-based algorithms.
